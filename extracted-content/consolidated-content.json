I highly recommend this office.\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Myr Go\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr Pedro, displays an easygoing attitude, attentively listens to your problems and offers solutions in easy to understand language all while maintaining a professional attitude.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

I highly recommend this office.\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Myr Go\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr Pedro, displays an easygoing attitude, attentively listens to your problems and offers solutions in easy to understand language all while maintaining a professional attitude.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment!

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

      "comment": "A dental specialist that is a combination of: professionalism, detail oriented, honest & caring is a rare find these days! Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton",

      "comment": "A dental specialist that is a combination of: professionalism, detail oriented, honest & caring is a rare find these days! Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton",

I highly recommend this office.\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Myr Go\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr Pedro, displays an easygoing attitude, attentively listens to your problems and offers solutions in easy to understand language all while maintaining a professional attitude.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

I highly recommend this office.\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Myr Go\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr Pedro, displays an easygoing attitude, attentively listens to your problems and offers solutions in easy to understand language all while maintaining a professional attitude.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton\n                                                                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nDr. Pedro was very informative, compassionate, and empathetic.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment!

Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems.

I have a very difficult bite and needed a new bridge. Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Katherine Contino\n                                                                                                                                                    Web Developer\n                                                \n                                                \n                                            \n                                       \n                                    \n                                                       \n                             \n                                   \n\n                                \n\n                                    \n                                                                            \n                                            \n\n                                                                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                    \n\n\n\nTruly the best dental experience I’ve ever had.

      "comment": "A dental specialist that is a combination of: professionalism, detail oriented, honest & caring is a rare find these days! Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton",

      "comment": "A dental specialist that is a combination of: professionalism, detail oriented, honest & caring is a rare find these days! Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!\n\n\n\n\n  \n                                  \n\n                                                                                                             \n\n                                                                      \n                                                                       \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                   \n                                            \n                                          \n                                        \n                                            \n\n                                                  \n\n                                                                         \n                                                    Christine Felton",

      "comment": "A dental specialist that is a combination of: professionalism, detail oriented, honest & caring is a rare find these days! Dr. G. Pedro placed 4 implants for me well over 15 years ago. I moved out of town & subsequently had 2 more implants placed by another prosthodontist. One of the 2 recent implants failed. I came back to Dr. Pedro to save the day by rectifying the situation. The original titanium implants of 15 years have not given me any problems. Do not give a second thought of having anyone else other than Dr. Pedro placing implants into your mouth- you’ll be smiling again & be extremely satisfied with his level of expertise!",

Other dentists did not want to try– with time and expertise, Dr. Pedro succeeded in creating a perfect bridge! He has successfully branched into the field of aesthetics. I tried the deep moisturizing machine and received myriad compliments after the first treatment! I have also tried the Opus plasma treatment and my skin feels wonderful!! These are a couple of many fabulous, non-invasive treatments which Dr. Pedro offers in his Dental office. How glamorous to these treatments offered while having dental work!! It’s heaven!!!",
