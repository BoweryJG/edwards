# HIPAA Compliant Row Level Security Migration

## Overview

This migration updates all Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure HIPAA compliance and proper authentication-based access control for the Dr. Pedro dental practice management system.

## Files Created

1. **hipaa_compliant_rls_policies.sql** - Main migration script
2. **check_current_rls_policies.sql** - Script to audit current state before migration
3. **rollback_hipaa_rls_policies.sql** - Rollback script if needed
4. **HIPAA_RLS_MIGRATION_README.md** - This documentation file

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. Patient Data Protection (PHI)
- **Before**: Anyone could view all patient records
- **After**: Patients can only view/update their own records; Staff with proper authentication can view patient records

### 2. Appointment Access Control
- **Before**: Anyone could view all appointments
- **After**: Patients see only their appointments; Staff see all appointments; Anonymous users can only create new appointments

### 3. Financial Data Security
- **Before**: Any authenticated user could view financial data
- **After**: Patients see only their financial records; Only staff can manage financial transactions

### 4. Phone/SMS Communication Privacy
- **Before**: Various levels of access based on user_id
- **After**: Only service role (backend) can access phone/SMS data to prevent unauthorized access to communication logs

### 5. Audit Trail Implementation
- **New**: Complete audit log table tracking all access and modifications to sensitive data for HIPAA compliance

## Migration Steps

### 1. Pre-Migration Checks

Run the check script to document current state:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i /path/to/check_current_rls_policies.sql
```

Save the output for reference.

### 2. Apply Migration

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i /path/to/hipaa_compliant_rls_policies.sql
```

### 3. Verify Migration

Run the check script again to verify policies were updated correctly.

### 4. Test Application

Test all critical functions:
- [ ] Patient registration (anonymous users)
- [ ] Appointment booking (anonymous users)
- [ ] Patient login and viewing own data
- [ ] Staff login and patient management
- [ ] Backend services (SMS, phone calls, etc.)

## Important Considerations

### Authentication Structure

The migration assumes:
- Patients table has `auth_user_id` column linking to Supabase auth
- Staff table has `auth_user_id` column for staff authentication
- Service role is used for backend operations

### Breaking Changes

1. **Anonymous Access**: Limited to only essential booking operations
2. **Patient Data Access**: Requires authentication to view any patient data
3. **Staff Access**: Requires active staff record linked to auth user
4. **API Changes**: Some endpoints may need to use service role for operations

### Application Updates Required

1. **Frontend Authentication**:
   - Implement proper patient login/registration flow
   - Add staff authentication for admin areas
   - Update API calls to handle authentication errors

2. **Backend Services**:
   - Ensure SMS/phone services use service role
   - Update any direct database queries to respect RLS

3. **Booking Flow**:
   - Anonymous users can still book appointments
   - But they create minimal patient records
   - Full patient profile requires authentication

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, rollback using:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i /path/to/rollback_hipaa_rls_policies.sql
```

**Warning**: Rollback restores permissive policies. Only use if necessary and plan to re-implement security improvements.

## HIPAA Compliance Features

1. **Access Control**: Role-based access to PHI
2. **Audit Logging**: All access to sensitive data is logged
3. **Minimum Necessary**: Users only see data required for their role
4. **Data Integrity**: Patients cannot modify critical medical data
5. **Authentication**: Proper user identification required

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Audits

Query the audit log regularly:

```sql
-- View recent access to patient data
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
WHERE table_name = 'patients' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 100;

-- Check for unusual access patterns
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(*) as access_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT table_name) as tables_accessed
FROM audit_log
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY access_count DESC;
```

### Performance Considerations

- RLS policies add overhead to queries
- Monitor query performance after migration
- Consider adding indexes for auth_user_id columns if not present

## Support and Questions

For issues or questions about this migration:
1. Check Supabase logs for RLS policy violations
2. Review audit_log table for access patterns
3. Test with different user roles to identify issues
